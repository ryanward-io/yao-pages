# Simple Website for a friend

Simple, (relatively) responsive website for a friend to put on GitHub pages. The site features a sticky navigation bar, a hero section with centered text, and a footer that remains at the bottom of the page.

When you take it feel free to remove the footer or change it to your own name.
